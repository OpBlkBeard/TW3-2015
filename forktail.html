<td><b>Bestiary Description:</b><q>Forktails... Bah! Fuckers' tails're more like cleavers. 
— Yavinn Buck, veteran of the Mahakaman Volunteer Regiment 

Forktails owe their quaint name to the long, sharp growths at the tip of their tails. A blow from this weapon can slice an oaken shield in two — along with the arm that was carrying it. Thus, though its name conjures images of cutlery, fighting a forktail is nothing like a dinner party and ends in death rather than dessert.</q>

<td><b>Tactics:</b>Wyverns & Forktails are relatively easy enemies to defeat, even at very high levels, once you've learned their attack patterns. The Quen Sign is not a must here, but can make this fight go much more smoothly. Frenzy, from the Alchemy Skill Line, is also excellent as it allows you dodge the Wyvern's counterattacks with ease.

The basic strategy is simple dodge forward and to the left when it attacks. This will put you behind or to the side of the Wyvern / Forktail, allowing for 3 or 4 attacks before it dodges away and spins to face you. When it dodges back you will miss your attack and this is your cue to dodge as it is about to counterattack. If you fail to dodge your Quen Sign will negate the damage and there will be no need to heal.

Periodically the Wyvern / Forktail will take flight, circle a time or two and then dive at you. There is no real danger here as you can easily see it coming and a dodge will put you out of harms way. Wyverns & Forktails have only one difficult attack to read and it is a tail swipe that should only happen once or twice through out the whole fight. If you have your Quen Sign then there is no need to worry, if you don't and it should hit you, it will deal most of your health so be prepared to heal.

Simply rinse and repeat this strategy for an easy victory.</td>
