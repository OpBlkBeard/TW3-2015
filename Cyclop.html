<td><b>Bestiary Description:</b><q>How about this... we take a big stake, sharpen its tip, jam it in the cyclops' eye — then sneak out of the cave disguised as sheep. How's that not a good idea? 
— Odess Thaka, traveler. Died tragically on Spikeroog 

Cyclopses can easily be recognized by the single eye located in the center of their foreheads. If for some reason that is not visible, other tell-tale signs are their enormous size, incredible strength and a seething hatred for all humans.</q></td>

<td> <b>Tactics:</b>Cyclopses are some of the more difficult creatures in the game to kill. Their sheer size makes them have very long reach when they swing which is nearly possible to dodge. Quen Sign is a must for these enemies early on as 1 hit takes about 3/4 of your health.

The best strategy I have found is to hit them once or twice and dodge backward or left. You will only manage to dodge its attacks about half of the time, unless you want to play it safe and only hit with one fast attack. You can kill it this way, but it will take you a VERY long time.

Attacks to watch out for are its charge attack where it swings repeatedly while running straight at you. If this first swing connects you will most likely die as it is all but guaranteed it will connect with one or two more hits that you won't be able to dodge. Make sure to at least dodge the first hit and you will not die.

You also want to watch out for an attack where he jumps up in the air and comes straight down. It is easy to see and has a long wind up, but the range is deceptively long and can hit you for about 90% of your health in one go, depending where you are standing. Stand further back then you think you should, just to be safe.

This fight will take a long time. Make sure you have full potions ready and use Ogroid Oil if you have it.</q>
