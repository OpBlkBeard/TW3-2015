<td><b>Bestiary Description:</b><q>Wolves aren't as bad as they're made out to be. Werewolves, though they're every bit as bad and worse.
— Elsa Vilge, archer</q></br>

Werewolves are creatures with both men and wolves inside them. When in beastly form, they take the worst traits from each: the wolf's drive to kill and hunger for raw flesh and the man's cruel and calculating intelligence. A werewolf's condition comes about through a curse, and the transformations happen outside his conscious control. When he reverts to human form, he has no memory of his deeds — otherwise he would surely go mad and take his own life."
