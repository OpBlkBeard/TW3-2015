<td><b>Bestiary Description:</b><q>Most dangerous of all are the royal wyverns. Or, as they're called in some circles, the royal pains in the arse. 
— Albino Tottelkampf, lecturer in natural sciences at Aretuza 

Wyverns are often mistaken for dragons, and, though they are much smaller than their more famous kin and do not breathe fire, they are likewise extremely dangerous monsters. Especially feared are the so-called royal wyverns who, like their namesake monarchs, are exceptionally ornery and extremely deadly.</q></td>
